Week 1 Ideas:

The Javascript Canvas:

The entire game is drawn and played on a canvas. Mega man, all projectiles, and enemies are drawn with sprite-based animations. Keypresses are watched for user input, and the game's main engine functionality is called periodically with setInterval.

Object-oriented design is used in almost all aspects of the game, as functions are called to check collisions between mega man, platforms, projectiles, and enemies.
