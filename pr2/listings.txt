Our process is the anti-process: what's the minimum overhead we can put up with to keep our code quality high, all while building features as quickly as possible? It's not just features, either: faster development means happier developers. The GitHub experience provides useful lessons for start-ups in general and I will share some of\nthese examples and the lessons I think these have for students wanting to do their own start-ups.\"\n\nZach works at GitHub.
