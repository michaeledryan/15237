"Fake" listings.txt

Dates update to be 1-hour apart?


STRETCH

make filters scroll.

Auto-populate end time to be one hour after start time


USER TEST 1
User tried to click map to add instead of add new listing.

Tried to just click on map.

Checked calendar for event.

Wasn't clear if it was a datepicker.

Long host into small field?

Map did not update when event added.

Unsure what room the event is in.

Now way to go from listing to map

Map seems like jumping off point.

Wait! I made a typo: switch to "Place your pin!"

Feedback is tied with "go back"

Focus on day in date field?

Timeframe is size of scope,Happening around is target 

Confusing between the two.

USER TEST 2
Knew to go to add listing

Misclicked a lot, especially around date field. Maybe those are awkward?
