Refresh Button!!!!

Clicking on labels should change the checkboxes

refreshDOM whenever you change filter time as well.

Comment code!

Assemble process work and readme

"Fake" listings.txt

Dates update to be 1-hour apart?


STRETCH

Hide "Add Listings" if not in use.
  Maybe expand it if you click on the map, but not an event. Collapse after some time?

  When would we hide it again once it's expanded?

make filters scroll.

Auto-populate end time to be one hour after start time


USER TEST 1
User tried to click map to add instead of add new listing.

Tried to just click on map.

Checked calendar for event.

Wasn't clear if it was a datepicker.

Long host into small field?

Map did not update when event added.

Unsure what room the event is in.

Now way to go from listing to map

Map seems like jumping off point.

Wait! I made a typo: switch to "Place your pin!"

Feedback is tied with "go back"

Focus on day in date field?

Timeframe is size of scope,Happening around is target 

Confusing between the two.

USER TEST 2
Knew to go to add listing

Misclicked a lot, especially around date field. Maybe those are awkward?


Used clicks to view files, not the bottom listings or the filters.

Thought "Add to map" was confusing. Switch to "Pick a spot" or something like that.

Liked the cursor change

Party events?

Test 3:

Knew to use left-hand bar

Got to talk without filters.

Sort by type? ehh.

Likes the calendar image!

Thought we should hide the whole "Add Listings" bar if it wasn't being used.
